# Breast-cancer-predictions-using-ML
A beginner-level machine learning project that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Includes data cleaning, visualization, preprocessing, and logistic regression modeling in Python.

This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. I started by cleaning the datasetâ€”removing unnecessary columns like `id` and `Unnamed: 32`, and converting the `diagnosis` column into binary values (0 for benign, 1 for malignant). I then visualized key patterns using Seaborn plots (countplot, boxplot, heatmap) to understand the distribution and relationships of features. After preprocessing with `StandardScaler` and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, I trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn. The model achieved strong accuracy, successfully classifying tumors and demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow from data to prediction.
